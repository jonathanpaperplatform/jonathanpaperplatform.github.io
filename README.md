# Top Conference Paper Search

A lightweight, user-friendly search engine dedicated to retrieving recent research papers from top-tier machine learning and computer vision conferences. Designed for researchers, students, and industry practitioners to quickly locate relevant work by core metadata.

## 🌟 Core Features



* **Supported Conferences**: Covers recent proceedings of four flagship venues (ongoing updates):


  * ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning)

  * NeurIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems)

  * CVPR (IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)

  * ICCV (IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision)

* **Multi-Dimensional Search**: Retrieve papers by:


  * Author name (exact match or fuzzy search)

  * Affiliation/Institution (e.g., Stanford University, Google Research)

  * Paper title (keyword-based matching)

  * Conference Venue (filter by specific conference)

* **Ongoing Updates**: Continuously syncing latest conference proceedings and expanding historical data coverage.

## 🚀 Quick Start



1. Access the search platform via the official URL (provided separately).

2. Select your preferred search dimension from the dropdown menu (Author/Affiliation/Title/Venue).

3. Enter your query terms (e.g., "Yann LeCun", "MIT", "transformer for image recognition", "CVPR 2023").

4. Click "Search" to view filtered results, including paper titles, authors, affiliations, conference year, and direct links (where available).

## 🔍 Search Tips



* **Author Search**: Use full names for best results (e.g., "Fei-Fei Li" instead of "Fei Li").

* **Affiliation Search**: Support partial matches (e.g., "UC Berkeley" will return results for "University of California, Berkeley").

* **Venue Filter**: Combine with other search terms to narrow down (e.g., "self-supervised learning" + "NeurIPS").

* **Recent Focus**: Currently prioritizes papers from the past 5 years; older archives are being added incrementally.

## 📋 Status & Roadmap



* **Current Status**: Core search functionality available for recent conference years (2020–present). Data synchronization in progress for earlier years.

* **Upcoming Features**:


  * Advanced filters (publication year, citation count, open-access status)

  * Paper abstract previews and direct PDF links

  * Saved search queries and result notifications

  * Expansion to additional top venues (ECCV, ACL, ICLR)
